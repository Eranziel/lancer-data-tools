Whether you’re a talented rookie or a grizzled veteran, you’ve gained a level of notoriety through your piloting ability that has your callsign known throughout the system. Most enemy pilots flee when they recognize your mech’s distinctive livery, but some see your reputation as a chance to test their own mettle...",

At the end of that character’s turn, even if they are no longer in line of sight or movement range from you, your mech may fly to any free adjacent space to that target as a reaction, as long as there is a path to do so.
