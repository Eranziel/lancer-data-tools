The swarm viewed itself not as a machine or a collection of machines, but as a single mind, duplicated across multiple units. This mind was classified as an NHP, given their current codename - OROCHI - and remitted to Venus for further study. At a later point, the hardware comprising OROCHI's physical form(s) went missing from containment.
